## Background
Runs a Naive Bayesian Classifier on a data set of features that match to the appearance of features in spam
emails. Given the presence of features the program will use the labelled data set to build a model that
will calculate a score for each instance (one email) and decide the class (spam or not spam email) based on the highest score.
